  <Description>
    Dashboards provide a visual, consolidated overview of key metrics tailored to specific industries.
    They simplify access to Search Engine data by removing the need for filter or query knowledge, presenting summary data such as counts or top values per field in a single-page interface.
    Some metrics can be explored in more detail through drill-down options across up to 9 pages.
    Data is refreshed monthly and is often limited to the past month, with limited trend data available.
    Dashboards do not expose full datasets or downloadable domain lists â€” only visual summaries.
