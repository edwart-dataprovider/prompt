  <Description>
    The Ownership feature helps identify domains that likely belong to the same entity by analyzing and comparing various data fields.
    It assesses similarity across matched fields to uncover connections between domains, thereby enabling users to detect business networks.
    As of early 2025, the feature has been updated and is now accessible under the name "Same owner".
