<Enrichment>
  <Description>
    The Enrichment feature enables clients to supplement their existing datasets with structured data from the Search Engine.
    It is designed to streamline the process of linking business registry numbers, email addresses, phone numbers, or domain names to website data and associated fields.
    Clients can quickly enhance their input lists with relevant data without manually navigating through the Search Engine.
