<Recipes>
  <Description>
    Recipes are pre-configured datasets designed to help users quickly and accurately access relevant web data without needing to build filters or queries manually.
    Most Recipes are centered around specific technologies (e.g., CMS, analytics tools, payment providers, hosting services), while others target issues like outdated server software.
    Recipes are especially useful for novice users who may not know which filters to apply to construct meaningful datasets.
