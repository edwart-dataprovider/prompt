    <Comparison>
      <PublicCrawl>Search Engine: information is publicly crawled and shared with all clients.</PublicCrawl>
      <PrivateCrawl>KYC: information is privately crawled based on uploaded lists and shared only with the uploading client.</PrivateCrawl>
    </Comparison>
    <Separation>
      KYC data is not added to the Search Engine. This is crucial for sensitive or non-public zone files (e.g., registry-specific lists).
