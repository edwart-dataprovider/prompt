<ConnectionIndex>
  <Description>
    The Connection Index is a proprietary, standardized score reflecting estimated traffic to a specific hostname. 
    It is calculated by dividing the daily raw DNS requests to that hostname by the total DNS requests to www.google.com over the previous 30 days.
    This normalization enables the analysis of traffic trends independent of fluctuations in overall traffic volume.
