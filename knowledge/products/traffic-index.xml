<TrafficIndex>
  <Description>
    Traffic Index is a proprietary metric developed by Dataprovider.com to estimate global website traffic using anonymous and aggregated recursive DNS data.
    Unlike traditional traffic tools using trackers or plugins, this method offers a scalable and privacy-safe alternative to assess real-world website usage.
    It provides a normalized signal of relative popularity and reach useful for benchmarking, lead qualification, trend analysis, and competitive research.

    <UseCase>
      <Client>A global investment firm evaluating payment service providers (PSPs)</Client>
      <Need>Measure real-world usage beyond online presence</Need>
      <Reason>
        DNS-based traffic data captures traffic from connected devices and checkout terminals, enabling comparison of API traffic volume across PSPs.

    <BotDetection>
      <Method>
        Detect patterns like uniform access across many hostnames and high-volume queries to flag bots.

    <UserDeduplication>
      <Approach>
        Measure unique users (via Unique IDs) to avoid bias from apps that generate many DNS requests (e.g., Slack vs. Teams).
      </Approach>
    </UserDeduplication>

    <Normalization>
      <Approach>
        Normalize traffic data relative to monthly traffic to www.google.com to account for sample size changes.
