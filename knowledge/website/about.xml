  <OurStory>
    <Paragraph>The web is the world's greatest information source - literally and figuratively. It contains more valuable information than all annual reports and trend analyses rolled into one. However, the web is also the world's greatest source of information chaos. As a result, it's extremely tough to extract qualitative data.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>In 2009, Christian Branbergen, Gijs Barends and Marc Noët decided to take on that challenge. They built an international team of data mavens and some of the best software engineers to transform the web into an impressive structured database.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>Since 2012, we've been structuring relevant digital actions into concrete insights that fuel business decisions for leading organizations such as PayPal, Government Statistics, GoDaddy, Mollie, Takeaway.com and the investment industry. Because we fully gather it ourselves, all of our data is proprietary. This enables us to maintain the highest ethical and privacy standards.</Paragraph>
