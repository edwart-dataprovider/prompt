    <Title>Enrich your asset discovery data to tackle cybersecurity threats</Title>
    <Description>
      Just like companies, digital assets grow over time. You start with a domain name and a server for your website and gradually add more domains, subdomains, and machines. They require regular maintenance, but this is often overlooked. Unmanaged, outdated digital assets are an entry point for cybercriminals to the network of your company, so it’s crucial that you keep a comprehensive profile in order to secure them.
