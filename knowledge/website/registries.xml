          Support your registrar partners with an in-depth overview of domains that are at risk of hacking, phishing attacks, and other security threats.

        <Title>gTLDs: Increase renewals and registrations</Title>
        <Description>
          Get a 360-degree view of the domains in your zone file. Apply our data filter ‘Response’ to discover how many are active business websites, blogs, placeholders, or parked domains. Dig deeper and filter by ‘Country’, ‘Website type’, ‘Language’, ‘SIC major group’, and more. That way, you can help your registrar partners run targeted marketing campaigns: for example, offer SSL certificates to online stores or website builders and email hosting to parked domains.

        <Title>ngTLDs: Grow your market share</Title>
        <Description>
          With the influx of nTLDs getting registered each day, you need to apply a more creative and strategic approach to promote your TLD. Identify new customers by searching for domain names that contain your TLD. For example, select the data filters ‘Title’, ‘Description’, ‘Keywords’, and ‘Company name’ to discover all domains that contain “space” (www.intelligentspace.com) and can benefit from a shorter and more targeted domain name: www.intelligent.space.
